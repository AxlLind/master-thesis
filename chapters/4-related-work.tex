\chapter{Related work} \label{ch:related-work}
This chapter described all identified related works done in the area and specifically against the hardware used in the system. Very little has been published regarding security of this system, as far as the author is aware. Two sources that explore systems based on the hardware from the same manufacturer (Climax Technology) have been identified and these are described below.

\section{Examination of LUPUS-Electronics devices}
This section details a security analysis of a very similar system, built on similar hardware from Climax Technology, done by \textit{Embedded Lab Vienna for IoT \& Security} (ELVIS). This is a teaching project run by the Competence Centre for IT-Security at the University of Applied Sciences Campus Vienna in Austria.
