\chapter{Penetration testing} \label{ch:pentesting}
This chapter details all penetration tests that were performed on the system. These were derived from the threat model created in chapter \ref{ch:threat-model}. All penetration tests are described in the format outlined below. If an aspect of the test was considered simple then one or more parts have been omitted.
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{Introduction}. Describes the attack vector that this penetration test will explore.
    \item \textit{Background}. Details the required background knowledge to perform and evaluate this penetration test, if any.
    \item \textit{Method}. Describes in detail how the test was performed, e.g in what environment, with what tools, what commands were used, etc.
    \item \textit{Results}. Describes the findings of the penetration test.
    \item \textit{Discussion}. This section contains a discussion about the reliability, validity, and generalizability of the results.
\end{itemize}

\section{Task 1: Online Password Attack}
An online password attack refers to probing an active login, as opposed to an offline attack where you for example might try to crack a hash of a leaked database. This attack involves using some type of approach to test many passwords of a login form to try and find valid credentials.

\section{Task 2: Climax Technology's Vesta platform} \label{ch:pentesting:vesta}
Climax Technology, the manufacturer of the hardware used in this system, does not seem to be a consumer-facing business. Nonetheless, they have their own software platform to control their system, called \textit{Vesta}. In the SecuritasHome system this platform and it's components are essentially replaced by \textit{Alarm.com}. The Vesta platform features a mobile application\footnotelink{https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.climax.vestasmarthome.eu}{2021-04-20} to control the system, as well as a web portal\footnotelink{https://eu.vestasmarthome.com/Vesta/}{2021-04-20}. A potential security vulnerability is if this Vesta platform is still active and usable to control this system.
